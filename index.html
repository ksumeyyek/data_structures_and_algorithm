  <p>
    The series begins in 2030 when Ted Mosby tells his children how he met
    their mother (his own wife). Voiced by Bob Saget as the main character,
    Ted, "I'll tell you how I met your mother." says and the series goes back
    to 2005. Bays and Thomas wrote about the friendship in the series based on
    their own friendship. Accordingly, while the character of Ted is mostly
    Bays, the characters of Marshall and Lily are inspired by Thomas and his
    wife.
