    <h2>Favorite Drama</h2>
    <h3>How I Met Your Mother</h3>
    <p>
      The series begins in 2030 when Ted Mosby tells his children how he met
      their mother (his own wife). Voiced by Bob Saget as the main character,
      Ted, "I'll tell you how I met your mother." says and the series goes back
      to 2005. Bays and Thomas wrote about the friendship in the series based on
      their own friendship. Accordingly, while the character of Ted is mostly
      Bays, the characters of Marshall and Lily are inspired by Thomas and his
      wife.
